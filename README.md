# Convert SVG to PNG

This is a simple web server that converts from SVG to PNG using [Apache Batik](http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/using/transcoder.html).  You can see it in action by submitting the [form on FileFormat.Info](http://www.fileformat.info/convert/image/svg2png.htm).

The code is deliberately simple to avoid dependencies.  All necessary libraries are included.

The included [run](run.sh) and [deploy](deploy.sh) shell scripts use Google AppEngine
but the code should work on any recent Java web server.
