# Convert a SVG to a PNG

This is a simple web server that converts from SVG to PNG using [Apache Batik](http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/using/transcoder.html).  You can see it in action by looking at the form at [FileFormat.Info](http://www.fileformat.info/convert/image/svg2png.htm).

The code is deliberately simple to avoid dependencies.  All necessary libraries are included.

You will need Jetty installed to run in development.  The included deploy script pushes to [AppFog](https://www.appfog.com/) but should work on any recent Java web server.
